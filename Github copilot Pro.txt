Now Lets work on Adding Features to Our code

# Feature one: There is Source references, but it would have been better, if we could refer these course and make these links clickable

Prompt:The chat interface should display query responses with source citations, where each source is a clickable link that opens the corresponding lesson video in a new tab. To achieve this:

Update @backend/document_processor.py so that when courses are split into chunks, the lesson link from the course_catalog collection is stored.

Modify _format_results in @backend/search_tools.py to include these lesson links in the response.

Ensure the links are embedded invisibly (no raw URLs should appear in the text).

Do not do anything, verify this first and share ur findings
